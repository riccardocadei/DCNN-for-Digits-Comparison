# EE-559 Project1

## General Information

The repository contains the code for Project 1 of the Deep Learning (EE-559) course at EPFL during Spring term 2021. 

### Team
The project is accomplished by:
- Riccardo Cadei: [@riccardocadei](https://github.com/riccardocadei)
- Riccardo Fradiani: [@riccardofradiani](https://github.com/riccardofradiani)
- Niccol√≤ Polvani: [@nickpolvani](https://github.com/nickpolvani)

### Abstract
In this study we compare different Deep Neural Networks to predict the inequality among 2 gray-scale images representing handwritten digits from MNIST database. Advantages of weight-sharing and auxiliary loss are also discussed. Training the models on a training set of 1 000 couples of images we got a test error rate equal to 2.96\%.

### Environment
The project has been developed and test with `python3.8.3`.

Required libraries: `Pytorch`, `matplotlib`.
