# Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Digits Comparison

The repository contains the code for Project 1 of the [Deep Learning (EE-559)](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/deep-learning-EE-559) course at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) during Spring term 2021.

### Abstract
In this study we compare different Deep Neural Networks to predict the inequality among 2 gray-scale images representing handwritten digits from MNIST database. Advantages of weight-sharing and auxiliary loss are also discussed. Training the models on a training set of 1 000 couples of images we got a test error rate equal to 2.96\%.

For a detailed description of our solution, read [`report.pdf`](https://github.com/riccardocadei/DCNN-for-Digits-Comparison/blob/main/report.pdf)

### Environment
The project has been developed and test with `python3.8.3`.

Required libraries: `Pytorch`, `matplotlib`.
